talk about the how to use the parcel and setup on it!

while install the there is two type of -D and -P which is use  { like _dev dependency }

there is two important thing is here is that when same version of package is ther like "parcel" : "^2.8.3 " 

^ =  carret { for the minor update} eg : 2.8.3 = 2.8.4

~ = tilta { for the major update } eg : 2.8.3 = 3.0.0

talk about the package.lock.json { its lock a exact version of the packages and keep all the dependency (history) }
